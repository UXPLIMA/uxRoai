# uxRoai Product Positioning

## Core Value Proposition

- Natural-language Roblox feature generation
- Self-testing / playtesting built into the core loop
- Studio plugin + external desktop app
- Non-coders shipping production features

## uxRoai Product Direction

`uxRoai` targets a powerful AI-driven Studio workflow, with two strategic pillars:

1. **Agent openness:** Action schema is explicit and extensible.
2. **Test-first architecture:** Test scenario generation is part of the core flow before/after coding.

## Key Technical Opportunity (late 2025+)

`StudioTestService` enables programmatic Play/Run test execution from Studio plugins.
That makes a native Studio loop practical:
"AI writes code -> AI playtests -> AI reports result."

MVP focus remains speed: a working local agent + Studio plugin loop.
